// Chocolate Distribution Problem

// Given an array of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

// Each student gets one packet.
// The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.



#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// arr[0..n-1] represents sizes of packets
// m is number of students.
// Returns minimum difference between maximum
// and minimum values of distribution.
int findMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int m)
{
	// if there are no chocolates or number of students is 0
	if (m == 0 || n == 0)
		return 0;

	// Sort the given packets
	sort(arr, arr + n);

	// Number of students cannot be more than number of packets
	if (n < m)
		return -1;

	// Largest number of chocolates
	int min_diff = INT_MAX;

	// Find the subarray of size m such that difference between last (maximum in case of sorted) and first (minimum in case of sorted) elements of subarray is minimum.

	for (int i = 0; i + m - 1 < n; i++) {
		int diff = arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i];
		if (diff < min_diff)
			min_diff = diff;
	}
	return min_diff;
}

int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41, 30,
				40, 28, 42, 30, 44, 48, 43, 50 };
	int m = 7; // Number of students
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	cout << "Minimum difference is: "
		<< findMinDiff(arr, n, m);
	return 0;
}



// Input : arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56} , m = 3 
// Output: Minimum Difference is 2 
// Explanation:
// We have seven packets of chocolates and we need to pick three packets for 3 students 
// If we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get the minimum difference between maximum and minimum packet sizes.
